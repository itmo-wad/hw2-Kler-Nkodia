Repository for Homework #2 (https://wad.itmo.xyz/assignments/homework2.html). Author: Kler, N41513c

The basic part of the homework is located in "basic-server_with_gallery" folder.  

## "Basic part" steps:
1. Create web application, which can host your image gallery:
1. Listen on localhost:5000
1. Render HTML document on http://localhost:5000/
1. Show static images on http://localhost:5000/img/<image_name>
1. Your external CSS and JS files should be returned on http://localhost:5000/static/<js/css filename>


In the future, I'm going to complete the rest of the parts.
